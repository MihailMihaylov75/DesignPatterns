"""
broken_chain.py â€” Event-broker/Observer flavored Chain-of-Responsibility demo.

This example wires a lightweight in-process event bus (Game.queries) where
'modifiers' subscribe and adjust a Query in response to creature attribute lookups.
It demonstrates a responsibility chain realized via observers that may mutate the
Query (attack/defense) and then let others continue.
